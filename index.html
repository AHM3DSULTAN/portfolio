    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
My name is Ahmed Sultan and I study computing at Loreto College. I really enjoy learning about technology and coding. I like working with HTML, CSS, and Python, and I also enjoy designing app interfaces using Figma. At college I have worked on website projects, databases, and programming tasks which helped me understand how software and hardware work together. Outside of class I make my own small programs and design app screens, which has helped me practice problem solving and paying attention to details. I want to keep learning and building projects that are useful and look good.    </p>
