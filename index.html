    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Ahmed Sultan, a 17-year-old computing student currently studying at Loreto. I have a strong passion for coding, particularly in HTML, CSS, and Python, where I enjoy building clean, functional, and user-friendly projects. In addition to programming, I have a keen interest in designing app user interfaces, often using Figma to bring creative and intuitive UI concepts to life. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, experiment, and grow in both development and design.
